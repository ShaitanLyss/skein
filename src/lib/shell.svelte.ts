/* The floating shell — one long-lived `pwsh` per project, and everything the
 * panel draws.
 *
 * Two shapes worth knowing before reading this.
 *
 * **The panel closing does not close the shell.** Alt+I is a toggle over
 * something that is already running, the way nvim's floating terminal is, so a
 * build you started stays started while you go back to the wall and read what
 * an agent said about it. The process only ends when you ask it to, or when the
 * app does.
 *
 * **There is one shell per project, not one for Skein.** Every session is keyed
 * on a project's root — which is also the id Rust holds it under, so the key is
 * derived rather than allocated and survives the front end being rebuilt. The
 * one on screen is the last project you touched a card in (`activeShellKey`),
 * so the panel is already in the right tree by the time you have opened it; the
 * others keep running behind it, which is why the header says how many.
 *
 * Holds Tauri subscriptions and has no lifecycle of its own, so `App.svelte`'s
 * `onDestroy` releases it — see ./listeners.ts for what a leaked one costs.
