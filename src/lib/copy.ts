/* What leaves the panel when you copy.
 *
 * The transcript draws markdown as elements, so what the browser hands the
 * clipboard is the words with every mark taken off: a numbered list that is no
 * longer numbered, a bold label that is no longer a label, a fence that arrives
 * as loose lines of code. But an answer copied out of here is nearly always on
 * its way somewhere that reads markdown — a commit message, an issue, a note,
 * another agent's prompt — so the marks are the half you most want kept.
 *
 * It is put back together from what is drawn rather than sliced out of the
 * source text, because a selection is a DOM range and only the DOM knows where
 * one starts: the range is cloned, and the clone is walked back into markdown.
 * The walk is pure and takes `Bit`s — the little of a node it needs — so it is
 * tested without a browser (test/copy.test.ts); `bitsOf` is the ten lines that
 * turn a real fragment into them.
 *
 * A partial selection gives back a partial document, which is the honest
 * answer: half a table is not a table, and the half you dragged across is what
 * you asked for. What a clone cannot know is what it was inside — select the
 * middle of one bullet and the fragment has no list in it, so no `-` is
 * written.
