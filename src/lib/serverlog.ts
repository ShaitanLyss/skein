/* A dev server's own words, hung on the wall.
 *
 * The other instruments in the catalogue read something nobody else is
 * watching — a clock, a process table, an allowance. This one reads a thing the
 * app already holds: `servers.rs` pipes every group's stdout and stderr up as
 * `server:log`, and `GroupRuntime.log` is where the wall keeps it. So there is
 * no sampler here and nothing to attach to, which is the whole reason a
 * `Servers` holder was not invented for it: the lines arrive as events and this
 * is a second reading of state that is already live. See `.claude/rules/servers.md`
 * for why they arrive through pipes rather than a pseudo-terminal, and
 * `ansi.ts` for how the colour survives that.
 *
 * The first of three log widgets, and the one the other two were cut out of:
 * what any log needs — how many lines fit, which subject it is about, what a
 * filter that emptied the pane owes you — is in `logface.ts`, and what is left
 * here is everything that is true of a *dev server group* and of nothing else.
 * A group has ports and per-server health and a button that starts it; a build
 * has a verdict, an editor log has verbosities. Three subjects, three widgets,
 * one substrate.
 *
 * Pure — no runes, no DOM — so which group a widget is about, what a filter
 * hides, and what to say about a server that is not saying anything are all
 * testable directly. `ServerLog.svelte` draws it. */
