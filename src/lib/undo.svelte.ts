/* The wall's undo stack, and the hands that put a record back.
 *
 * All the reasoning is in `./undo.ts`, which is pure and holds the whole state
 * machine. This file adds two things: the runes, so the menu and the keyboard
 * can read what each direction would do, and a `Hand` — one function per realm
 * that writes a snapshot back where it came from.
 *
 * ── two ways an act gets recorded, and why there are two ──────────────────
 *
 * **Where a gesture already has a commit point, the act is recorded there.** A
 * card dropped, a territory let go, a menu item clicked: something in the code
 * already knows the gesture is over, because that is where the row gets written.
 * `did()` is called there, once, with every record the gesture touched — which
 * is what makes dragging a territory of five pinned cards *one* press to undo
 * rather than six.
 *
 * **Where the mutation is the gesture, the act is streamed and fused.** A widget
 * being dragged or resized writes its box every frame and nothing anywhere knows
 * when you will let go; a knob nudged in the context menu fires once per click
 * with no bracket around the series. Those places call `note()` on every change
 * and `remember`'s fusing window collapses the run into one act. It is the same
 * bargain `Widgets.#saveSoon` strikes one layer down — the database only needs
 * where a thing came to rest, and so does the stack.
 *
 * The consequence worth knowing: `Widgets` and `Board` record their own edits,
 * from inside `add`/`update`/`remove`, so every caller gets undo for free —
 * including the control surface, which is how `wall.test.ts` can drive it.
 * `Studio` deliberately does *not*: placements are recorded at the gestures'
 * own commit points, for the territory-drag reason above. */
