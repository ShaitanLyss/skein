/* What is left of the allowance, and when it comes back.
 *
 * `limits.rs` asks `/api/oauth/usage` and answers in facts — a percentage, a
 * reset instant and the rate limiter's own name for each window. Everything a
 * person actually wants is here: what to call a window, which one is about to
 * stop you, how close to the edge counts as close, and how to say a countdown
 * that may be five minutes or five days. The same split `usage.ts` draws against
 * `usage.rs`, and for the same reason.
 *
 * Pure — no runes, no DOM, no `invoke` — so all of it has direct Bun tests.
 *
 * **This is the file that made "no percentage of an allowance" wrong.** The note
 * at the top of `usage.ts` argued at length that no limit is knowable from this
 * machine, and every fraction that file draws is a fraction of the wall's own
 * recent history because of it. That argument was true about *transcripts* and
 * false about the account: `rateLimits` really is null on every record, and the
 * endpoint the CLI's own `/usage` reads was simply never looked for. So the two
 * live side by side and answer different questions — `usage.ts` says what the
 * work has cost, this says how much of the allowance it has eaten — and only
 * this one may draw a percentage, because only this one has a real denominator.
