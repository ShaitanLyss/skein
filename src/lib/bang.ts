 * puts what the command printed into the model's context as
 * `<local-command-stdout>`, and over `claude --print` there is no route to
 * inject context without opening a turn. So the honest arrangement is two
 * gestures rather than one — Enter runs it and the transcript keeps the record;
 * Ctrl+Enter runs it and then *says* it, as a prompt, which costs a turn
 * because it is one. See `.claude/rules/bang.md`.
 *
 * This file is the pure half: what a draft means, how the line is coloured,
 * where a completion lands, and what the agent is told when you hand a run
 * over. Nothing here knows what a shell is. Tested directly
 * (`test/bang.test.ts`).
