/** What a card is called — and what it is called before it is called anything.
 *
 *  A title arrives in three stages: a card is opened and has none, the first
 *  prompt cuts one out of what you said, and once a turn lands Claude Code's own
 *  generated title replaces it (`Skein.#adoptAiTitle`). The first stage used to
 *  be drawn as the literal word "untitled", which is the sentinel's spelling and
 *  not a thing to show anybody — it is the one moment a card is asking to be
 *  given something to do, and it said the least of any state on the wall.
 *
 *  So the sentinel stays exactly where it was (it is read by the store's default,
 *  by `#deliver`, by the wall's footprints and by the process meter) and only
 *  what is *drawn* changes: an unnamed card wears the draft you are typing at it,
 *  cut the same way sending it would cut it, and before you have typed anything
 *  it wears the plainest true statement about itself.
 *
 *  Pure, per the purity boundary — the naming rules are testable and nothing
 *  here touches a rune or an invoke. */

/** The stored spelling of "this card has never been named".
 *
 *  Not a label. It is `title`'s DEFAULT in the schema (`store.rs`), the test in
 *  `#deliver` that decides whether the first prompt gets to name the card, and
 *  the test everything that *draws* a name asks before drawing it. */

 *  Deliberately not "nothing said yet" — the open density already says that, in
 *  the card's own body, about the transcript. Two lines of a card telling you
 *  the same absence twice is a card with one thing to say. This one is about
 *  identity rather than contents: it is a thread, and it is new. */
