  /* The strands, painted.
   *
   * One canvas in screen space and a frame loop that does nothing but call into
   * `flow.ts` — where the curve is, how far the braid is twisted this
   * millisecond, which pulses are still on the wire, when a strand is over.
   * Nothing here decides anything you could assert; that is all next door.
   *
   * Five things about it are deliberate, and four of them are the same four
   * `Backdrop.svelte` states one layer down:
   *
   * - **Screen space, not canvas space.** A strand has to reach a card on the
   *   wall and a card stuck to the glass, and screen space is the only frame
   *   those two share. It also means a strand keeps its width at every zoom,
   *   which is the point: zoomed out to see the whole studio is exactly when
   *   you want to see who is talking to whom.
   *
   * - **The loop stops when nothing is flying.** `Flights.sweep` decides, and
   *   an empty wall runs no frames at all.
   *
   * - **Endpoints are read fresh every frame, untracked.** A card dragged while
   *   a message is crossing to it takes the light with it, and the pan does the
   *   same — the strand is between two *cards*, not between two points that
   *   were true 900ms ago.
   *
   * - **Colour is status, so there is exactly one here**: celadon, `--st-work`,
   *   because a message in flight is work moving between two cards. Read off the
   *   document with the ground beside it, so a derived theme gets both the tone
   *   and the compositing right with nobody remembering this file.
   *
   * - **Nothing is drawn under a card, only up to it.** `rimPoint` starts the
   *   light at the card's edge; the canvas sits above the wall and below the
   *   glass, so a strand crosses the ground and never a transcript.
