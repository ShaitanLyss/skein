# The control surface

### The control surface (`src-tauri/src/control.rs` + `src/lib/control.svelte.ts`)

Off unless `SKEIN_CONTROL=1` (or a pinned port number). It binds loopback, writes
`%APPDATA%/dev.skein.studio/control.json` with a fresh token, and lights a chip in the title
bar. `POST /op` with `X-Skein-Token` runs one op in the studio and returns its answer.

```powershell
$env:SKEIN_CONTROL="1"; bun run tauri dev     # terminal 1
bun tools/ctl.ts health                        # terminal 2
bun tools/ctl.ts ops                           # the full vocabulary
bun tools/ctl.ts snapshot cards
bun tools/ctl.ts send card=skein text="hello"
bun run test:wall
```

Two rules make a green run mean something, and both are easy to break:

1. **Ops drive the app's own seams.** Injecting an event goes out as a real `conv:event` and
   comes back through Rust to the same listener the supervisor talks to; a dropped file goes
   out as a real `tauri://drag-drop`. Never add an op that reaches into component internals
   or builds a parallel path.
2. **Synthetic vs real pointer.** `click` dispatches a synthetic event and proves only that
   handlers are connected. `real.click` / `real.drag` move the actual Win32 cursor, and are
   the only thing that can see Chromium retargeting a real click after `setPointerCapture`.
   They need a **second** opt-in, `SKEIN_CONTROL_INPUT=1` — `SKEIN_CONTROL` alone must never
   arm the mouse.

There is no `eval` op, on purpose. Editing any front-end file hot-reloads `App.svelte` and
constructs a second `Control`; a generation counter on `window` (not module scope) keeps the
superseded one silent — this once caused a single `open` op to spawn two agents.

The same hazard applies to anything holding a Tauri subscription. `Skein`, `Attention` and
`Control` are plain classes with no lifecycle, so **`App.svelte`'s `onDestroy` releases them**
via `Listeners` (`src/lib/listeners.ts`). Skip that and a superseded `Skein` keeps ingesting
events *and writing rows* — one `result` became one `turn` row per generation. `snapshot`
reports `listeners.skein` / `listeners.attention` / `listeners.actions` so a leak is visible
from outside: they must not climb across an edit (7, 3 and 2 today). Module-level timers need the same care — see the
`clock` interval's `window` handle in `conversation.svelte.ts`.

`test/wall.test.ts` only ever creates conversations under `.scratch/`, and closes them in
`afterAll`. Keep it that way, so running it cannot disturb real work on the wall.
