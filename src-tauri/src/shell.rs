//! The shell that floats over the wall.
//!
//! One long-lived `pwsh` (or `powershell`, or `sh`) reading commands off its
//! stdin, with both its streams pumped back as lines. It is deliberately *not*
//! a terminal emulator and deliberately not a PTY, which is the opposite call
//! from the one dev servers made — see `.claude/rules/shell.md`. The short of
//! it: ConPTY is broken on this machine, every `openpty` child dies at
//! `0xC0000142` before it runs, and a floating terminal that cannot start a
//! shell is worse than a line-oriented console that can.
//!
//! Because nothing here is a terminal, the shell prints no prompt of its own
//! (probed 2026-08-17 against PowerShell 7 with `-Command -` over pipes: no
//! prompt, no echo, output streamed line by line as it happened, SGR colour
//! intact). Skein draws the prompt instead, which means it has to be *told*
//! where the shell is and whether the last command worked. That is the marker
//! below: after every command we write a second line that prints the exit
//! status and `$PWD`, recognise it on the way back out, and turn it into a
//! `shell:done` rather than into output. The PowerShell in it stays here, next
//! to the argv it belongs with; the front end never learns that a marker
//! exists.
