//! Where Claude Code is, whether it is really Claude Code, and how to get one.
//!
//! Every card on this wall is a `claude` child process, so "claude is not on
//! PATH" is the one failure that makes the whole app do nothing — and it is
//! also the one most likely to be a lie. A per-user install that was never
//! added to PATH, a shell that has PATH but a GUI app launched from Explorer
//! that does not, an install under a package manager's own bin directory: all
//! three look identical to `Command::new("claude")` and none of them means the
//! CLI is missing.
//!
//! So: **look before installing.** PATH first, then every directory an install
//! is actually known to land in, and only after all of those come up empty is
//! anything downloaded.
//!
//! ### The trap, and it is a real one
//!
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\claude.exe` exists on a machine with the
//! **desktop app** installed and is not the CLI. Probed 2026-08-19 on this
//! machine: it answers `--version` with `1.21459.3`, where the CLI beside it
//! answers `2.1.235 (Claude Code)`. It is a plausible-looking `claude.exe` in a
//! plausible-looking Anthropic directory, it is roughly a third of a megabyte
//! against the CLI's three hundred, and a discovery routine that trusted the
//! filename would spawn it for every card on the wall and get nothing back that
//! anything here can parse.
//!
//! Hence `verify`: a candidate is Claude Code when it *says* it is. `--version`
//! must answer, and the answer must carry the words `Claude Code`. A version
//! number alone is not enough, because the desktop app has one of those.
//!
//! ### Installing
//!
//! `https://claude.ai/install.ps1`, which is the Windows sibling of the
//! `install.sh` the CLI carries a reference to (both strings are in the binary;
//! `install.ps1` appears three times). Run through PowerShell, and **never
//! without being asked for** — `install` is a command the front end calls after
//! putting the question, not something `find` does when it comes up empty. An
//! app that downloads and executes a script from the network because a lookup
//! failed is an app that does that on a typo'd PATH.
