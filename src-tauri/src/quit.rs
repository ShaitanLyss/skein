//! Whether closing the window should go through the first time it is asked.
//!
//! Skein's close is unconditional and has to stay that way in spirit: quitting
//! takes every card's process tree down with it, and a background job spared at
//! shutdown is a process nothing can ever reap. See `.claude/rules/turns.md`,
//! "a row is not a handle". What this adds is not an escape from that, it is a
//! sentence before it — a wall with a twenty-five-minute import on it says so
//! rather than losing it silently and explaining at the next launch.
//!
//! **The answer has to be here rather than asked for at the moment of closing.**
//! `CloseRequested` is handled on the main thread inside the event loop, and the
//! only thing that knows which cards are busy is the webview — which cannot be
//! asked a question synchronously from there, and may not answer at all. So the
//! wall keeps this counter current as its jobs come and go (`note_busy`), the
//! same bargain `store::set_mid_turn` strikes for a turn: write the fact through
//! as it changes, so the code that runs at exit only has to read it.
//!
//! **And a second close always goes through**, which is the whole safety story.
//! Anything else risks an app that cannot be quit — the failure `lib.rs` already
//! carries a comment about, whose only remedy was Task Manager. If the webview
//! is wedged, or the counter is stale, or the dialog never paints, pressing
//! close twice exits. That is also what the dialog's own "quit anyway" does: it
//! closes the window again rather than calling some third command, so the
//! confirmed path and the escape hatch are one path and there is no way for them
//! to disagree.
