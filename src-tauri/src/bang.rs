//! `!` in the dock: running one line, and completing one line.
//!
//! Two unrelated jobs that share a shell dialect, which is why they are one
//! file — the same argument `shell.rs` makes for keeping its marker next to its
//! argv. Neither of them is the floating shell, and the difference is worth
//! being clear about before reading either.
//!
//! **A run is a process per command.** The floating shell is one long-lived
//! `pwsh` you keep talking to; a `!` line is not. It is spawned, told one thing,
//! and its stdin is closed — which is what `-Command -` reads as "that is
//! everything", so the shell runs it and exits. No marker is needed anywhere
//! here: the process ending *is* the end of the command, and its exit status is
//! the status. That is the whole reason this is not a second client of
//! `shell.rs` — the marker exists because a shell that outlives its commands
//! cannot otherwise say when one finished, and this one dies to say so.
//!
//! **Completion is one long-lived shell, and it never runs your code.** The
//! opposite call, for the opposite reason: `TabExpansion2` costs about 2s the
//! first time it is asked for a command name (it builds the command cache) and
//! single-digit milliseconds afterwards, so a process per keystroke is not a
//! feature that works. It is deliberately *not* the floating shell's session,
//! which is the obvious economy and is wrong: that shell is busy running your
//! build, and completion queued behind a ten-minute `cargo build` is completion
//! that does not exist.
//!
//! Probed 2026-08-18 against PowerShell 7 over pipes, which is where the shape
//! of all of this comes from:
//!
//! ```text
//! 'Get-Chi'            n=1  1919ms   ← the command cache, built once
//! 'Get-Chi' (again)    n=1     3ms
//! 'ls src/l'           n=1     7ms   ReplacementIndex=3 Length=5
//! 'Get-ChildItem -Pa'  n=1     1ms   ReplacementIndex=14 Length=3  -Path
//! 'git sta'            n=0    98ms   ← nothing, and see the rule for why
//! ```
//!
//! The spans are the payload. PowerShell says *what it would replace* as well as
//! what with, so nothing on the front end has to work out how much of `src/li`
//! a path completion eats — see `.claude/rules/bang.md`.
