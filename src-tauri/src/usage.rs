//! What Claude Code has spent, read off the transcripts it writes anyway.
//!
//! The limits this answers to are **per account, not per app** — a five-hour
//! window and a weekly one, both counting every turn taken on this machine
//! whether Skein spawned it or a terminal did. So the source has to be the same
//! one `history.ts` reads for scrollback: `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl`,
//! every session on the machine, not Skein's own `turn` table. The `turn` table
//! knows only what this wall did, which is the wrong denominator for "am I about
//! to be cut off" and is empty for cards opened before it started recording
//! properly (see `migrate_v7`).
//!
//! Three facts about the file format carry this whole module:
//!
//! - **One API response is several records.** A turn with a thinking block and a
//!   text block writes *two* `assistant` lines, and both carry the same
//!   `message.usage` verbatim — the same numbers, not halves. Summed naively a
//!   reasoning turn counts two to five times over. So a line is folded in only
//!   once per `message.id` + `requestId`, which is the pair that identifies one
//!   request. Probed 2026-08-14 against claude 2.1.229's own transcripts.
//! - **`usage.iterations[]` repeats the same field names.** `input_tokens` and
//!   friends appear again inside it, per iteration, so nothing here may match on
//!   a bare key name — the record is parsed properly and read by path.
//! - **Cache writes are two prices, and the file says which.**
//!   `cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` and `…_1h_…` are 1.25x and 2x
//!   input respectively — a factor of 1.6 between two numbers it would be easy
//!   to add together. `store.rs::migrate_v7` had to separate reads from writes
//!   for the same reason; this is the next split down and it is free, because
//!   the transcript already keeps them apart.
//!
//! Rust answers in facts and never in verbs — the split `perf.rs` draws. What a
//! token *costs*, which window it falls in, and what to call the reading are
//! `usage.ts`'s, which is pure and tested. This file returns buckets.
